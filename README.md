# Image Grid Layout

## Description
The **Image Grid Layout** project is a hands-on exercise aimed at helping developers practice creating responsive image grids using **CSS Grid**. This project consists of six images, arranged in a dynamic grid layout, including scenes like a foggy beach, a modern living room, a food table, a red-doored building, apartment buildings, and a beach view from a hill.

This project is inspired by a task listed on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/image-grid), a platform that offers guidance for learning web development. It is ideal for gaining experience with **CSS Grid**, responsive design, and image optimization. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring flexibility and a user-friendly experience across devices.

## Features
- **CSS Grid Structure:** Learn to define grid containers, rows, columns, and place items within the grid.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout dynamically adapts to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Image Optimization:** Images use `object-fit: cover` to maintain a consistent aspect ratio without distortion.
- **Mobile-friendly:** A single-column layout is applied for screens under 850px width.
- **Cross-browser Support:** Compatible with all major web browsers.
